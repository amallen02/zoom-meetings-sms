This Genesys Cloud Developer Blueprint describes how agents can schedule meeting with customers using Zoom and Genesys Cloud. Now agents can schedule Zoom meeting right from Genesys Cloud. Genesys Cloud automatically sends the customer an SMS message with the meeting URL and opens Zoom for the agent. As long as the call is in a queue, it can be inbound or outbound.

The following illustration shows the meeting scheduling solution from the perspective of an agent.

![Zoom agent view](images/zoom-workflow.png "Meeting scheduling solution to use Zoom from an agent's point of view")

The following is an example of the end-to-end experience customers and agent  can expect from this blueprint.

![Overview](images/ZoomVideoSMSBlueprint.gif "Overview")

You can enable an agent to create a Zoom meeting from their Genesys Cloud agent UI by using public APIs provided by Genesys Cloud and Zoom. The following illustration shows Genesys Cloud and Zoom API calls.
